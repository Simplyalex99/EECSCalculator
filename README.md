## Description
An extension for yorku students that calculates **culminative** and **overall** gpa of one's query in  the degree progress report(https://w6prod.sis.yorku.ca/yda/student) or york university course grade page(https://wrem.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/ydml.woa/wa/DirectAction/document?name=CourseListv1)

- Now click on the gpa calculator icon and then enter your choice. You can now see your gpa of choice whenever you need to!

  **Note: Must also be on one of the webpages specified in the  description to calculate your choice of gpa**

## Demo
For example, choosing yorku degree progress report (DPR) as the website to calculate EECS gpa, still on the page now click on the gpa calculator extension which will display the app. Now entering LE/EECS will give the overall gpa for all eecs courses and display all related courses  and grades corresponding to that faculty. In addition,  the total grade points and credits will be displayed that can be used as a reference. Then entering SC/MATH to get overall math gpa, including total credits and grade point for math. Now to calculate MAJOR GPA combine the 2 reference values , sum the total gradepoints and divide it by the sum of total credits.



### To-do:
Improve structure of code for maintainability.

## Motivation:
Currently, there is no way to view eecs gpa or math  or any certain course gpa in either sites provided by York. The only current way to get such grades to see if you meet the requirements for coop, or internship or a certain course is to go to yorku gpa calculator website and manually type in the grade received and credit value. Its not much a problem when its a few courses, but over the years students take lots of courses and having to re-calculate is time-consuming. This extension allows users to calculate their gpa in a click a button of their choice!

### Special thanks:
