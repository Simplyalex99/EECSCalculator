- Download the folder degreeProgressReport with its files (You can please find an arrow in the green bar "Code" subheading that has an option to download via zip)

- Add the files as a browser extension; In the browser go to extensions or in tool bar click on "Window" then "extensions", enable dev tools and click "load unpack" then select the degreeProgess folder.
  
- Enable the extension so it can be visible. (top right corner click on puzzle icon then click on pin for "eecs calculator" extension).

- Copy the URL of the website and replace the URL next to the "matches" in manifest.json file with your URL of the page.

- Make sure to save then refresh the extension anytime changes are made.

- Click on the gpa calculator extension and then enter your choice. You can now see your gpa of choice whenever you need to!

  **Note: If the following error appears on the console "runtime.lastError", refresh the webpage. Must also be on one of the webpages specified in the  description to calculate your choice of gpa**

## Demo
For example, choosing yorku degree progress report (DPR) website to calculate gpa, copy that link and then replace the url that is inside the manifest.json next to "matches" with the url that was copied , still on the same page as DPR now you  click on the gpa calculator extension then enter LE/EECS which will give you the overall gpa for all eecs courses and display all related courses  and grades corresponding to that faculty. In addition,  the total grade points and credits will be displayed that can be used as a reference. Then entering SC/MATH to get overall math gpa, including total credits and grade point for math. Now to calculate MAJOR GPA combine the 2 reference values , sum the total gradepoints and divide it by the sum of total credits.
