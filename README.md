  **Note: Must also be on one of the webpages specified in the  description to calculate your choice of gpa**

## How to use
For example, choosing yorku degree progress report (DPR) as the website to calculate EECS gpa, still on the page now click on the gpa calculator extension which will display the app. Now entering LE/EECS will give the overall gpa for all eecs courses and sessional and overall gpa. If there is no need to see a certain faculty/department gpa, then simply click submit will show overall and sessional gpa but not the query gpa.

### To-do:
Improve structure of code for maintainability and add more life quality improvement in the future.

## Motivation:
Currently, there is no way to view eecs gpa or math  or any certain course gpa in either sites provided by York. The only current way to get such grades to see if you meet the requirements for coop, or internship or a certain course is to go to yorku gpa calculator website and manually type in the grade received and credit value. Its not much a problem when its a few courses, but over the years students take lots of courses and having to re-calculate is time-consuming. This extension allows users to calculate their gpa in a click a button of their choice!

## Important Notice

- You might find that you get 2 different gpa values if you try York university degree progress and york univeristy grades page. This is because York university degree report is the most up-to-date with one's grades compared to the other site which takes some time for the school to update. So its not the extension.

- This is an extension that runs only on a script and **no servers are involved** in leaking  or having access to personal information. This app is not in anyway associated with York university. **This extension is built for the purpose of being an utility** for students at york university to use with ease without the need to manually calculate their GPA.
